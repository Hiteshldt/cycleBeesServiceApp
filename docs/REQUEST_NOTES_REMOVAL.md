# Request Notes Feature - Removal Documentation

**Date**: 2025-10-19 **Status**: ✅ Removed **Migration**:
`003_remove_request_notes.sql`

---

## Summary

The `request_notes` feature has been completely removed from the project as it
was an orphaned/incomplete feature with no UI integration.

---

## Analysis Results

### Table Status (Before Removal)

- **Exists**: ✅ Yes
- **Data**: ❌ 0 rows (empty)
- **UI Components**: ❌ None
- **Admin Dashboard**: ❌ Not integrated
- **Last Used**: Never

### API Endpoints (Removed)

1. ❌ `GET /api/requests/[id]/notes` - List notes
2. ❌ `POST /api/requests/[id]/notes` - Create note
3. ❌ `PUT /api/requests/[id]/notes/[noteId]` - Update note
4. ❌ `DELETE /api/requests/[id]/notes/[noteId]` - Delete note

---

## What Was Removed

### 1. API Route Files

```
app/api/requests/[id]/notes/
├── route.ts (DELETED)
└── [noteId]/
    └── route.ts (DELETED)
```

### 2. Database Table

- Table: `request_notes`
- Migration: `db/migrations/003_remove_request_notes.sql`

---

## How to Apply Removal

### Step 1: Verify Code Removal

```bash
# API endpoints already deleted
# Verify they're gone:
ls app/api/requests/[id]/notes  # Should not exist
```

### Step 2: Drop Database Table

**In Supabase SQL Editor**, run:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS request_notes CASCADE;
```

**Or use the migration file**:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents from `db/migrations/003_remove_request_notes.sql`
3. Execute

### Step 3: Verify Removal

```bash
# Run verification script
npx tsx scripts/analyze-request-notes.ts
```

Expected output:

```
❌ TABLE DOES NOT EXIST
✅ RECOMMENDATION: Removal complete
```

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to restore the table (though unlikely):

1. **Restore table structure**:

   ```bash
   # Run rollback migration
   # File: db/migrations/003_rollback_request_notes.sql
   ```

2. **Restore API files** from git:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 app/api/requests/[id]/notes
   ```

---

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ Safe to Remove Because:

1. **No Data Loss**: Table was empty (0 rows)
2. **No UI Impact**: No components referenced it
3. **No API Usage**: Endpoints were never called
4. **Clean Codebase**: Removes ~160 lines of dead code

### ✅ No Breaking Changes:

- Existing features unaffected
- No customer-facing changes
- No admin dashboard changes

## Alternative: If You Want Notes Feature

If you decide you need internal notes for requests in the future:

### Option 1: Add to Request Details

- Add `notes` column to `requests` table (simpler)
- Single text field for admin notes
- No separate table needed

### Option 2: Rebuild Feature

- Use rollback migration to restore table
- Build UI in admin dashboard
- Implement proper CRUD operations

### Recommendation

**Option 1** is simpler and more maintainable for internal notes.
