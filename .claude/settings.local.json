The API was using an INNER JOIN with selected_items filter, which would return no results when the array was empty.\n\nChanges:\n- Added conditional query logic: use INNER JOIN only when items are selected\n- When just marking as viewed (no items), use simple query without JOIN\n- Only update totals when items are actually selected\n- Added proper error handling instead of silent failures\n\nThis fixes the status update issue where orders would never get marked as ''viewed'' in the database.\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
